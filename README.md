The goal of this project is to accept/refuse/ignore registration who meets requirements on a tournament managed by Toornament.
It works with toornament Webhook and registrations are managed instantly (If the Toornament servers can not contact the 
webhook URL, the servers will try to send the data again during the next 24 hours).
